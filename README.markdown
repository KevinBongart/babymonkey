Babymonkey
==========

Babymonkey is a small Rails app that sends emails via [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com).
It can be used to test HTML email layouts.

Just set your API key in the mandrill.yml config file, then watch [a baby monkey going backwards on a pig](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_sfnQDr1-o).
